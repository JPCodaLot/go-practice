# Go Practice

Practice programs I wrote while learning the Go programing language.

## Disclamer

I am still just learning how Go works, so expect the folowing programs to be a bit janky and poorly implemented. What was important to me was the journey!

## Installation

1.  You will first need to install Go by folowing the instructions on it's [download](https://go.dev/dl/) page.
2.  Download the source code from GitHub.
    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:JPCodaLot/go-practice.git .
    ```
